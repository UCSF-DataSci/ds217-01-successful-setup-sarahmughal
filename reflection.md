# Getting to Know You

Welcome to DS217! Please take a few minutes to introduce yourself by answering these questions. There are no right or wrong answers - we just want to get to know you better and understand what you're hoping to get from this course.

## 1. Who are you and what's your background?
Hi! I’m a Master’s student in Health Data Science at UC San Francisco. After graduating with a Bachelor’s in Biology from UC Riverside, I worked at two Bay Area biotechn companies, Natera and Personalis, where I focused on liquid biopsy applications in early cancer detection, prenatal testing, and organ health. These experiences sparked my interest in data and ultimately led me to pursue this graduate program. Outside of academics, I love exploring coffee and matcha cafes, thrifting, and hiking, and I’m excited to spend more time in the city doing all of that!

## 2. What are you looking for out of this class?
Through this class, I hope to strengthen my Python programming skills and build confidence in applying them to real-world problems. In particular, I’m interested in using Python for data visualization in bioinformatics, such as exploring gene expression patterns or visualizing sequence alignments. My goal is to leave the course with practical skills that I can directly apply in my future career!

## 3. What are you most looking forward to or tentative about?
I find it exciting to see how programming can help scientists uncover new insights in health and biotech research, and I’m eager to learn how to do the same. I do feel a bit tentative about keeping up with the pace of coding assignments since I’m still fairly new to programming, but I’m motivated to practice and improve!
